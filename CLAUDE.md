## Commands
```bash
npm run dev      # Start development server
npm run build    # Production build
npm run start    # Serve production build
npm run lint     # Run ESLint
```

**Note:** Node.js is installed at `C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\nodejs\node-v22.14.0-win-x64`. It must be on PATH before running commands. Use the PowerShell pattern:
```powershell
$nodePath = 'C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\nodejs\node-v22.14.0-win-x64'
$env:Path = "$nodePath;$env:Path"
```

## Design System
- **Color tokens** defined in `globals.css` via `@theme` — `primary` (blue), `accent` (green), `slate` (neutral)
- **Design direction:** Clean modern interface with systematic grids, geometric typography, frosted glass effects, layered components with depth, precise alignment
- **All icons** are inline SVGs from Heroicons (outline style, 24px)
- **Animations** use Framer Motion — `AnimatedSection` component for scroll-triggered reveals, `motion` for hero animations and floating orbs

## Key Patterns
- All section components are client components (`"use client"`) because they use Framer Motion
- The `QuoteModal` is controlled by `page.tsx` state and passed via `onQuoteClick` props
- The Navbar uses a transparent-to-frosted-glass transition on scroll
- Server-rendered: the booking engine needs route handlers, server actions and a database
- Testimonials section uses a grid on desktop and a carousel with AnimatePresence on mobile

## Business Details (placeholder)
- **Phone:** (555) 123-4567
