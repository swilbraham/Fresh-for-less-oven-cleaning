 * Weekly commission run — Vercel cron hits this every Monday morning.
 *
 * It bills every completed job that isn't already on an invoice, not just ones
 * inside the labelled week, so anything completed late still gets picked up
 * rather than silently falling through the gap. The unique index on invoice
 * lines means a double trigger can't double-bill.
 *
 * Inert on a solo site: there is no commission to bill and nobody to bill it
 * to. The route still answers 200 so the cron entry can stay in vercel.json
 * across both modes without its failures filling the operator's logs.
